                <h4>Poland</h4>
            </header>
            <p class="destination-description">Poland is a country located in Central Europe, East from Germany. Poland
                has everything - beaches up north, mountains
                down south, thousands of lakes in Masuria, history of Cracow and many more. It is also pretty budget
                friendly - as the
                costs of living are not that big compared to its western neighbors. With its medieval history, you
                can visit hundreds of
                castles, such as the most famous one - The Wawel Castle and learn about the legend of Wawel Dragon.

                <h4>Mars</h4>
            </header>
            <p class="product-description">Being the 4th planet in The Solar System and with recent rapid
                development of rocket science - it surely will become an interesting &lpar;and expensive&rpar;
                tourist attraction... Maybe. Well, as for now, the planet has nothing but red rocks, but with
                SpaceX's recent development of Falcon rockets, we can expect it to change. The only problem is,
                we have no idea when and IF that will happen anywhere in our closest future.</p>

                <h4>Antarctica</h4>
            </header>
            <p class="product-description">Antarctica is the geographically southmost continent of our planet.
                Surrounded by the Southern Ocean and being twice as
                large as Australia, it is by far the least populated continent on Earth. On average it is the
                coldest, windiest and
                driest continent and has the largest average elevation change. It also was the the last continent to
                be discovered. If
                you think that Antarctica tourism is a crazy idea, then you must know that it has been an
                interesting place to visit for
                many people ever since 1960s.</p>

            <p class="product-description">In the recent years, Iceland has seen a spike of tourism that doesn't see
                a stop. The country being located on the North
                Atlantic Ocean, it is slowly becoming more famous, thanks to its hot geysers, which hurl boiling
